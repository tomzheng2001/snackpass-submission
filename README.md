Full stack app to display food items created for Snackpass Full Stack Code Challenge

Setup: run npm install in both the client and server folders and add all the necessary environment variables (mysql details and backend server url). The test data I used
are included in the "tables folder" and they can be imported into MySQL. I wrote all the create table sql statements in the connection.js file so it should automatically
create upon starting the server.
